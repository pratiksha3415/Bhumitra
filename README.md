# AI Land Consolidation Platform

## Introduction
The AI Land Consolidation Platform is designed to optimize land usage and facilitate efficient land redistribution using AI-powered analysis. This platform assists in auto-measuring land areas, plotting land boundaries based on image data, and streamlining land consolidation (Chakbandi) processes in rural and urban areas.

## Key Features
- **Automated Land Measurement** – Uses AI to calculate land areas accurately from satellite images and user inputs.
- **Land Boundary Plotting** – Extracts and maps land boundaries from Google Earth data.
- **Landowner Database Management** – Stores and manages land ownership records.
- **Cadastral Map Integration** – Incorporates official land records for precise planning.
- **Land Consolidation Optimization** – AI-driven algorithms to optimize land redistribution.
- **User Authentication** – Secure login and access control for stakeholders.
- **AI-Powered Decision Making** – Suggests optimal land redistribution strategies.
- **Report Generation** – Exports consolidated land reports in PDF and Excel formats.
- **Deployment & Hosting** – Ensures accessibility and scalability of the platform.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Python, Flask
- **Algorithm:** K-Clustering for map generation

## Expected Impact
The AI Land Consolidation Platform aims to improve land usage efficiency, reduce disputes, and support sustainable land management by leveraging AI and GIS technologies. This will benefit rural communities, government agencies, and private landowners by streamlining the consolidation process and enhancing decision-making.
